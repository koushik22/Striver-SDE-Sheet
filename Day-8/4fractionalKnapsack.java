/*
In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack. This problem in which we can break an item is also called the fractional knapsack problem. 
 

An efficient solution is to use Greedy approach. The basic idea of the greedy approach is to calculate the ratio value/weight for each item and sort the item on basis of this ratio. Then take the item with the highest ratio and add them until we canâ€™t add the next item as a whole and at the end add the next item as much as we can. Which will always be the optimal solution to this problem.

A simple code with our own comparison function can be written as follows, it sorts the item according to value/weight ratio in decreasing order. 
After sorting we need to loop over these items and add them in our knapsack satisfying above-mentioned criteria.

Below is the implementation of the above idea:

 class itemComparator implements Comparator<Item>
{
    @Override
    // Comparison function to sort Item according to val/weight
    // ratio in descending order
    public int compare(Item a, Item b) 
    {
        double r1 = (double)(a.value) / (double)(a.weight); 
        double r2 = (double)(b.value) / (double)(b.weight); 
        if(r1 < r2) return 1; 
        else if(r1 > r2) return -1; 
        else return 0; 
    }
}
class solve{
    double fractionalKnapsack(int W, Item arr[], int n) {
        Arrays.sort(arr, new itemComparator()); 
        
        int curWeight = 0; 
        double finalvalue = 0.0; 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    // If adding Item won't overflow, add it completely
            if (curWeight + arr[i].weight <= W) {
                curWeight += arr[i].weight;
                finalvalue += arr[i].value;
            }
                // If we can't add current Item, add fractional part
                // of it
            else {
                int remain = W - curWeight;
                finalvalue += ((double)arr[i].value / (double)arr[i].weight) * (double)remain;
                break;
            }
        }
